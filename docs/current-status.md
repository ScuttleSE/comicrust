# Current status

Update this file at the end of every work session. Replace stale content.
Do not append history. Git and `docs/archive/` hold history.

## Active phase

**Phase 17: Native modules II, the Library Organizer.**

The implementation and automated gates are complete. The three user tests
are open. See `docs/phases/phase-17.md` and `docs/open-user-tests.md`.

Phase 16, Comic Vine scraper quality of life, is PLANNED. No task started.
Phase 9, the SQLite database backend, is DEFERRED to `docs/backlog.md`.

## Current task

There is no active implementation task.

The user confirmed these four tests as passed on 2026-09-16:

- The 95,302-book Details view reaches both logical endpoints. Click and
  right-click actions reach rows near the endpoint.
- File opens without filling nested dynamic menus. Recent Books and Open
  Books fill when their own submenus open.
- Bulk deletion stays responsive. Progress, cancel, and the final refresh
  work on the real CIFS library.
- Cold startup shows the window before the watch-folder worker completes.
  The watcher installs later and detects a new file.

## Open user tests

The steps are in `docs/open-user-tests.md`.

1. Library-tree gauge badges.
2. Library-tree drag and drop.
3. Library-tree folder sort.
4. Select Worst Duplicates and the Incoming path rule.
5. Keyboard navigation and visibility.
6. Watch-folder removal.
7. Permanent delete in the browser.
8. Permanent delete in Files view and delete-failure handling.
9. Library Organizer simulation.
10. Library Organizer move and destination conflicts.
11. Library Organizer undo and profile import/export.
12. Details mode thumbnail suppression, Ctrl+A, and Delete.
13. macOS archive-junk recovery.
14. Smart-list dialog responsiveness.
15. Detail-column text overflow.
16. Per-list view settings.

## Open work

- Phase 16 has eight planned Comic Vine scraper tasks. Start with T1 in
  `docs/phases/phase-16.md`.
- The Library Organizer startup auto-run is deferred in `docs/backlog.md`.
- A DirectoryMatcher gauge evaluation measured approximately 2.6 seconds
  over 53,618 books on the GTK thread. No follow-up fix exists.
- `ShowOnlyDuplicates` writes to ComicDb.xml but does not restore per list
  in the UI.
- The `.deb` has no local package-content test because this machine has no
  `dpkg-deb`. The packaging workflow is its first full test.
- The AppStream metadata has no screenshots because no hosted image URLs
  exist.
- Other deferred features are in `docs/backlog.md`. Do not copy that list
  into this file.

## Open risk

Apache-2.0 is incompatible with GPL-2.0-only. The Apache-2.0 scraper port,
`ring`, and `webpki-roots` remain unresolved under ADR-041. The project does
not claim that the present combination is permissible. `cargo deny check
licenses` is not a CI gate.

## Latest verification

The full-library scroll fix is commit `5d2f9bb`.

- `cargo fmt --all`: passed.
- `cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings`: passed.
- `CR_FORMAT_TESTS=1 cargo test --workspace --locked`: passed.
- Release app and probe builds: passed.
- A release probe under `MemoryMax=2G` reached the final logical viewport
  with 95,302 Detail rows and exited normally.
- The user test passed on 2026-09-16.

## Environment notes

- Run UI probes in RELEASE with Xvfb, `GDK_BACKEND=x11`, `DISPLAY=:99`, and
  isolated XDG paths under `/tmp/opencode/`. Probes must not use the real
  library.
- `scanrefresh` gate E stalls in a DEBUG build on this machine. The base
  revision has the same result. Use RELEASE.
- `newbook` and `exportpage` reach `PROBE DONE`, then their watchdog exits
  with code 2. The base revision has the same result.
- `editor_probe` runs a main loop until an external timeout. This result is
  its normal completion.
